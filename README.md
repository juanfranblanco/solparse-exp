# Solparse Exp

Pegjs-based Parser for the Solidity Programming language.

This is a fork of [duaraghav8 Solparse](https://github.com/duaraghav8/solparse)which was originally a fork of [Consensys' solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) by Tim Coulter. @cgewecke, @duaraghav8 and @federicobond are co-authors.

## Note
This version was created primarily to work with https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity, and added IncompleteBlock to help on not completed statements, but over the years it continues to be updated, and provides another solidity parser to help the ecosystem.

If you are not interested in "IncompleteBlock" it can be removed or commented out for your own needs. 

Fixes welcome :)
